<h1>Survival Multiplayer Minecraft at its best</h1>

<p>
    Creeper's Lament is a survival multiplayer (SMP) 
    <a href="http://www.minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a> server. Our
    goals are to provide...
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Reliability. It sucks when someone gets in the way of your addic...
    hobby. The server only goes down for patching when new goodies are
    released.
  </li>
  <li>
    Performance. This is not being ran on a spare machine in someone's
    basement. We are hosted in a high grade data center in Atlanta, and
    are able to scale up to handle more players as needed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Safety. We back up aggressively, and are a white-list restricted
    server. Your creations will be safe, and should you choose to leave,
    feel free to take a copy of the 
    <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/mcserver-backups/latest.tar.bz2">latest world map</a> with you.
  </li>
  <li>
    Freedom from meddling. There are no in-game ops. Everyone must harvest,
    mine, and gather on their own. No freebies, no power-tripping mods.
    Changes and policies are discussed on our friendly 
    <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/creeperslament">mailing list</a>.
</ul>
